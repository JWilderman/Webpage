# Overview

The web app has 3 pages, a menu page, a page that uses input given by a user, and a page that has text and an image added. 
I have the menu html file selected and hit the button to launch the test server in order to have the first page. 
The button to launch the test server is added by the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey.

My purpose for writing this program was to show me what areas I need to work on improving my skills as well as showing me what areas I am proficient in.

# Web Pages

The first page is a menu page that has links to the other two pages. Users can chose which page they go to first. 
Page 1 has the links to the other pages and sends a prompt to get the name of the user. 
Page 1 will then display a message welcoming the user, using the name given in the window prompt.
Page 2 also has links to all other pages. 
When Page 2 is loaded, a message is added to the page and an image is added to the page.
